A React component is just a function that returns some JSX (HTML-like syntax).

React components must start with a capital letter.

.render is not embedded in JavaScript — it’s a method that React gives you.


.render() is a method provided by React’s root object.


Diffrence between innerhtml and .render()

innerHTML works with raw HTML strings → " <h1>Hello</h1> ".

.render() works with React elements/components → <Hello />.

innerHTML always replaces everything inside the element.

.render() updates only what changes, making React much faster for big apps.


In React, a function component must start with a capital letter to distinguish it from standard HTML elements. 
Here's an example:
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hi!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting />;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);

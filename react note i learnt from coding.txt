Note: How to Show Hidden Content When Clicked in React
Import useState from React — it lets your component “remember” things.
Make a state variable (e.g., showMenu) that starts as false (hidden).
Add a click handler to a button or image. When clicked, flip the state (true = show, false = hide).
Conditionally render the hidden content with {showMenu && <div>...</div>}.
This means: only display <div> if showMenu is true.
Do not add hidden CSS inside that div, because React is already controlling whether it shows or not.

💻 Example Code

import { useState } from "react";

export default function ToggleMenu() {
  // Step 2: create state (false = hidden at first)
  const [showMenu, setShowMenu] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Step 3: click to toggle */}
      <img
        src="settings.png"
        alt="settings"
        className="cursor-pointer"
        onClick={() => setShowMenu(prev => !prev)}
      />

      {/* Step 4: show content only when showMenu is true */}
      {showMenu && (
        <div className="p-4 bg-gray-200 rounded">
          <h5>Temperature</h5>
          <button>Celsius (°C)</button>
          <button>Fahrenheit (°F)</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

In plain words:

Click the image → React flips showMenu → React decides if the div should be displayed.




— useState, useEffect, and useRef are built-in React Hooks.
They all come from the React library itself, so you don’t install anything extra. You just import them:
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";
Quick breakdown:
useState → lets your component “remember” values between re-renders.
Example: track if the menu is open or closed.
useEffect → runs side effects (extra code that’s not just rendering).
Example: adding/removing the event listener for outside clicks.
useRef → gives you a way to directly reference a DOM element or store a value that persists without causing re-renders.
